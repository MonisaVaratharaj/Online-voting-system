1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Set up a PHP server environment (e.g., XAMPP, WAMP, or any PHP-supported environment. My choice is XAMPP).
3. Create a new folder within the 'htdocs' directory in your XAMPP(C:\xampp\htdocs) for Windows. Then, place the contents of this repository folder into the newly created folder.(eg.folder name : PHP-VOTING-SYSTEM)
4. The database schema is provided directly within the project folder. Locate and import the database schema file (e.g., `onlinevotingsystem.sql`) into your phpmyadmin (for XAMPP).
   
**4.1. The phpMyAdmin is defaulty have password as '', nothing , but I put password for it as 'root'
